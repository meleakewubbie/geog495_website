# Seahawks Themed Website
I created a Seahawks themed website that can be seen using the following link: https://meleakewubbie.github.io/nfl_website/
* The home page displays a nealry full screen youtube video about the NFC West divison in the NFL.
* The teams tab displays all teams within the Seahawks division as of October 17th, 2021.
* The photos tab displays the starting quarterbacks within the NFC West divison as of October 2021 utilizing an automatic image slider.
